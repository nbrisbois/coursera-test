		<h1>Echoes by Pink Floyd</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg col-md-1 col-sm">
				<p class="verse-num" id="v-1">Verse 1</p>
				<p>Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
				And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
				The echo of a distant tide
				Comes willowing across the sand
				And everything is green and submarine
				And no one showed us to the land
				And no one knows the wheres or whys
				But something stirs and something tries
				And starts to climb towards the light</p>
			</div><div class="col-lg col-md-1 col-sm">
				<p class="verse-num" id="v-2">Verse 2</p>
				<p>Strangers passing in the street
				By chance two separate glances meet
				And I am you and what I see is me
				And do I take you by the hand
				And lead you through the land
				And help me understand the best I can
				And no one calls us to move on
				And no one forces down our eyes
				No one speaks
				And no one tries
				No one flies around the sun</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg col-md-2 col-sm">
				<p class="verse-num" id="v-3">Verse 3</p>
				<p>Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes
				Inviting and inciting me to rise
				And through the window in the wall
				Come streaming in on sunlight wings
				A million bright ambassadors of morning
				And no one sings me lullabies
				And no one makes me close my eyes
				So I throw the windows wide
				And call to you across the sky.</p>
